# Welcome to Nearvault

Nearvault is a multisig wallet platform designed to simplify the management of developer and treasury assets for organizations building on the NEAR blockchain. With Nearvault, teams can securely store and jointly manage their:

- Treasuries
- Smart contracts
- Validators
- Native tokens
- And any other on-chain assets on NEAR

Developing a protocol or product in the crypto space presents unique challenges that are not encountered in traditional web2 environments. Nearvault offers a tailored solution to address these challenges, providing a user-friendly experience for crypto developers and operators when it comes to managing their core assets throughout the entire process of bringing their vision to life.

Throughout a team's journey, they may raise funding, deploy smart contracts, launch tokens, and start their own validators. Nearvault tackles three core problems related to managing these assets:

1. User Experience: Nearvault transforms many experiences that previously required developers to interact with the command-line interface (CLI) into well-designed user flows within an intuitive interface.

2. Security: Built on top of a robust smart contract wallet infrastructure layer for NEAR, Nearvault allows teams to secure ownership of their assets with multi-signature logic. This requires multiple signatories to approve actions, decentralizing control and eliminating single points of failure.

3. Transparency: By requiring multisig approvals for asset management and parsing relevant data into a human-readable format, Nearvault provides teams with greater transparency. This allows main stakeholders to have better visibility and control over critical actions in the development of their project.

Nearvault leverages a collection of smart contracts that enable developers to deploy and program smart contract wallets, representing the next generation of self-custody solutions on NEAR. The platform brings novel account abstraction features to NEAR, such as spending limits and permissions, enhancing the flexibility and security of asset management for organizations building on the blockchain.
